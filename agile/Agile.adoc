=== Kanban V/s Scrum

Scrum and Kanban are both Agile methodologies that focus on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of software development processes, but they have different approaches, practices, and principles. Here's a comparison of Scrum vs. Kanban:

1. **Framework vs. Methodology**:
- Scrum: Scrum is a framework with prescribed roles, events, and artifacts. It emphasizes time-boxed iterations (sprints), roles such as Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Development Team, and specific ceremonies like Sprint Planning, Daily Stand-ups, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective.
- Kanban: Kanban is a methodology that emphasizes visualizing work, limiting work in progress (WIP), managing flow, and continuous improvement. It does not prescribe specific roles, events, or ceremonies but provides principles and practices to optimize workflow.

2. **Time-Boxed vs. Continuous Flow**:
- Scrum: Scrum organizes work into fixed-length iterations called sprints, typically lasting 1-4 weeks. Teams plan work for each sprint and aim to deliver a potentially shippable product increment by the end of the sprint.
- Kanban: Kanban focuses on continuous flow, where work items move through the system as soon as capacity allows. There are no fixed timeboxes, and work is pulled into the system based on demand, with an emphasis on minimizing cycle time and maximizing throughput.

3. **Roles and Responsibilities**:
- Scrum: Scrum defines specific roles, including Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Development Team. Each role has distinct responsibilities for facilitating the Scrum process, managing the product backlog, and delivering the product increment.
- Kanban: Kanban does not prescribe specific roles but encourages collaboration and empowerment within teams. Team members are responsible for managing their workflow, making decisions, and continuously improving processes.

4. **Planning and Prioritization**:
- Scrum: Scrum involves detailed sprint planning sessions where the team selects items from the product backlog and commits to delivering them within the sprint. Prioritization is based on the product backlog, with the Product Owner determining the order of work.
- Kanban: Kanban focuses on visualizing work and prioritizing based on demand and capacity. Work items are pulled into the system as capacity allows, and priorities may shift dynamically based on changing requirements or feedback.

5. **Flexibility vs. Structure**:
- Scrum: Scrum provides a structured framework with defined roles, events, and artifacts. It offers a clear cadence for planning, executing, and reviewing work but may be less flexible in adapting to changes outside of sprint boundaries.
- Kanban: Kanban offers more flexibility and adaptability, allowing teams to adjust their processes and priorities in real-time based on evolving needs. It provides a lightweight framework that can be tailored to suit the specific context and requirements of the team.

Overall, while both Scrum and Kanban share common Agile principles and goals, they offer distinct approaches to managing and improving software development processes. The choice between Scrum and Kanban depends on factors such as team structure, project requirements, organizational culture, and desired level of flexibility.

=== Kanban Principles

Kanban is a visual management method that helps teams to visualize work, limit work in progress (WIP), and maximize efficiency. Kanban practices are designed to facilitate the smooth flow of work through the system while enabling continuous improvement. Here are some key Kanban practices:

1. **Visualizing the Workflow**: Kanban utilizes a visual board, often divided into columns representing different stages of the workflow (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done). Each task or work item is represented by a card or sticky note on the board, allowing team members to see the status of work at a glance.

2. **Limiting Work in Progress (WIP)**: Kanban emphasizes the importance of limiting the number of tasks or work items that can be in progress at any given time. This practice prevents overloading individuals or teams and helps to maintain a steady flow of work through the system.

3. **Managing Flow**: Kanban focuses on optimizing the flow of work through the system, aiming to minimize bottlenecks, reduce cycle times, and deliver value to customers more efficiently. Teams monitor and analyze the flow of work, identifying areas for improvement and making adjustments as needed.

4. **Making Policies Explicit**: Kanban encourages teams to define explicit policies or rules for each stage of the workflow, clarifying expectations and guiding decision-making. These policies help to standardize processes, improve transparency, and ensure consistent quality and throughput.

5. **Using Feedback Loops**: Kanban relies on feedback loops to continuously monitor performance, gather insights, and drive improvement. Teams collect feedback from various sources, such as customers, stakeholders, and team members, and use this feedback to adapt their processes and practices iteratively.

6. **Implementing Continuous Improvement (Kaizen)**: Kanban promotes a culture of continuous improvement, where teams regularly reflect on their processes, identify opportunities for optimization, and implement incremental changes to enhance efficiency and effectiveness. Kaizen events or retrospectives are commonly used to facilitate these improvement activities.

7. **Collaborating and Empowering Teams**: Kanban emphasizes collaboration and empowerment within teams, encouraging individuals to take ownership of their work and contribute to the success of the team. Team members are empowered to self-organize, make decisions, and take action to resolve issues and improve outcomes.

8. **Using Metrics for Decision-Making**: Kanban utilizes various metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure performance, track progress, and inform decision-making. Common metrics include cycle time, lead time, throughput, and WIP limits, which provide valuable insights into the health and performance of the system.

9. **Evolutionary Change**: Kanban recognizes that change is a natural and ongoing process, and it encourages teams to embrace evolutionary change rather than seeking radical transformations. Teams start where they are, gradually introduce Kanban practices, and evolve their processes over time based on feedback and learning.

By embracing these Kanban practices, teams can improve their workflow management, enhance collaboration and communication, and achieve higher levels of productivity and efficiency.

=== Kanban

NOTE: PS

Kanban originates from Toyota Production System, or TPS. TPS is a manufacturing philosophy that aims to eliminate waste and maximize efficiency, and it's also referred to as lean production system, lean manufacturing, or simply lean. Kanban is a Japanese word, and at Toyota, it refers to special cards used as a signaling system for just‑in‑time production. Just‑in‑time means making only what is needed, when it is needed, and in the amount needed, so there is no interruption or slow down in the production process. Kanban concepts had been born in manufacturing, but in the early 2000s, David Anderson adopted them for software development, and Kanban has been successfully used in the software industry ever since. However, the application of Kanban doesn't stop there. Now days, it's improving the delivery of products and services across a range of different industries. So what exactly is modern Kanban? If we summarize what we've just said, we can state that Kanban is a way of bringing lean thinking to an organization. If we want to be more precise, for now, we can say that *Kanban is a set of principles and practices for workflow optimization*. With that being said, I'd also like to make clear what Kanban is not. *Kanban is not intended to define the processes, Kanban only optimizes processes*. Also, the method doesn't specify how to implement the work, it only helps us manage workflows effectively. Kanban is simple. It's an excellent match for companies with a developed agile mindset. However, it surely helps other companies to be more responsive or adaptive, or even to become agile. But then, it's also true that you can use Kanban in other contexts with a straightforward goal to improve the workflows so companies can start with what they have with their already established processes, practices, roles, and simply introduce optimization by adding Kanban on top. The reason I'm talking about the simplicity and promises of Kanban is that this understanding is essential when considering the adoption. Having the right expectations in mind, we cannot argue about the drawbacks of the method because it doesn't require a significant instant change or investment. Anyone can try using Kanban on top of what they have and decide if it's the right fit for their organizational context, and, if so, agree to pursue the evolution. Okay, by now we've talked about what Kanban is, and now let's see how Kanban works in practice.

=== Metrics

NOTE: PS

Two key Kanban metrics, lead time and throughput.

*Lead time* is the amount of time it takes for a work item to flow through the system. Naturally, we want to minimize the lead time because the lower the lead time, is the faster work gets completed.

*Throughput* is the average number of finalized work items per time unit. For instance, if in each of the last four weeks, 8, 12, 9, and 11 cards have reached the Done column, weekly throughput is 10. You've probably noticed that here we measure the number of cards only, and some of you may wonder why we haven't taken their size into the calculation. Well, if cards varied in size significantly, we would, of course, calculate that in. But, typically, Kanban teams tend to create items of roughly the same size to smooth the flow further and make planning easier. A fascinating fact is that in a stable system, key Kanban metrics are nicely linked through a straightforward relationship known as Little's law. Little's law comes from queuing theory, but practice confirms its validity. The essence of this relationship is real and very actionable, so here it is. Average lead time is average work in progress over average throughput. So lead time, work in progress, and throughput are interdependent.

For instance, when we decrease the number of work items in progress, lead time goes down, and when we decrease lead time, throughput goes up. Or to put it differently, when we set the right WIP limits, work will be delivered faster. And when work is delivered faster, we fulfill more requests from our customers and users.

=== 12 Agile Priciples

The Agile Manifesto outlines 12 principles that guide Agile methodologies. These principles are:

1. **Customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery of valuable software**: Agile prioritizes delivering working software to customers frequently, ensuring their needs are met and allowing for feedback and adjustments throughout the development process.

2. **Welcome changing requirements, even late in development**: Agile recognizes that requirements can change and encourages embracing these changes, regardless of the project phase, to deliver a product that meets the customer's evolving needs.

3. **Deliver working software frequently, with a preference for shorter timescales**: Agile promotes delivering small, incremental releases of software, typically in iterations or sprints, to obtain rapid feedback and maintain a sustainable pace of development.

4. **Collaboration between business people and developers throughout the project**: Agile emphasizes close collaboration between stakeholders, including customers, product owners, and development teams, to ensure a shared understanding of goals and requirements and to facilitate timely decision-making.

5. **Build projects around motivated individuals, giving them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done**: Agile values motivated individuals and teams and provides them with the autonomy, resources, and support necessary to accomplish their goals, fostering a culture of trust and empowerment.

6. **The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation**: Agile advocates for direct, frequent communication among team members and stakeholders to facilitate shared understanding, collaboration, and problem-solving.

7. **Working software is the primary measure of progress**: Agile prioritizes delivering working software as the primary indicator of project progress, focusing on tangible results over documentation or other artifacts.

8. **Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely**: Agile promotes a sustainable pace of work, avoiding overloading team members and ensuring that they can maintain productivity and quality over the long term.

9. **Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility**: Agile emphasizes the importance of technical excellence and sound design practices, enabling teams to adapt to changing requirements and maintain the integrity and maintainability of the software.

10. **Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential**: Agile encourages simplicity in both the software itself and the development process, focusing on delivering the highest value with the least amount of unnecessary complexity or effort.

11. **The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams**: Agile trusts self-organizing teams to make decisions regarding architecture, requirements, and design, enabling them to adapt to change and innovate based on their collective expertise and experience.

12. **At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly**: Agile promotes regular reflection and adaptation through practices such as retrospectives, allowing teams to continuously improve their processes, collaboration, and performance.

These principles serve as a foundation for Agile methodologies, guiding teams in delivering high-quality software that meets customer needs through collaboration, adaptability, and continuous improvement.

=== Different Kinds of Issues in Sprint

In Agile methodologies such as Scrum, various types of issues or work items can be included in a sprint to represent the tasks that need to be completed by the development team. Here are some common types of issues that can be included in a sprint:

1. **User Stories:** User stories represent specific features or functionalities from the perspective of an end-user. They typically follow the format of "As a [user role], I want [goal] so that [reason]" and describe the desired outcome without specifying implementation details.

2. **Bugs:** Bugs are issues that describe defects or errors in the software that need to be fixed. They are usually reported by users, testers, or identified during development.

3. **Tasks:** Tasks represent smaller, actionable items that contribute to the completion of a user story or a larger piece of work. They can include activities such as research, documentation, coding, testing, or deployment.

4. **Sub-tasks:** Sub-tasks are smaller units of work that are part of a larger task. They can be used to break down complex tasks into manageable components and track progress at a more granular level.

5. **Improvement Stories:** Improvement stories focus on enhancements or optimizations to existing features rather than the development of entirely new functionality. They address areas for improvement based on user feedback, performance issues, or usability concerns.

6. **Technical Debt:** Technical debt represents the work required to address code quality issues, refactorings, or architectural improvements that have been deferred in previous sprints. It includes activities aimed at reducing complexity, improving maintainability, and ensuring the long-term health of the codebase.

7. **Epics:** Epics are large bodies of work that cannot be completed within a single sprint and need to be broken down into smaller, more manageable user stories or tasks. They represent high-level initiatives or themes that span multiple sprints and require coordination across teams.

8. **Chores:** Chores are non-functional tasks or housekeeping activities that are necessary for the maintenance or upkeep of the project but do not directly deliver business value. They can include activities such as updating documentation, setting up environments, or conducting code reviews.

By including a mix of these different types of issues in a sprint, teams can ensure that they address a variety of work items and make progress towards their sprint goals while delivering value to their stakeholders.

=== Problem Statement

You are working as an Agile Scrum Master and have been asked to perform spring planning in Jira for one of the projects. Demonstrate the steps to perform the same in Jira.

Certainly! Here's a step-by-step guide to performing Sprint Planning in Jira:

1. **Navigate to your Project in Jira:**
Log in to your Jira account and navigate to the project for which you want to perform Sprint Planning.

2. **Go to the Backlog:**
Click on the "Backlog" link in the project's sidebar. This will take you to the backlog view where you can see all the issues that are currently in the backlog.

3. **Create a New Sprint:**
At the top-right corner of the backlog, you'll see a button labeled "Create sprint". Click on it to create a new sprint. Give your sprint a name and set the start and end dates for the sprint.

4. **Select Issues for the Sprint:**
Drag and drop issues from the backlog into the new sprint. These are the tasks that you and your team will work on during the sprint. You can also use the Jira query language (JQL) to filter and search for specific issues to include in the sprint.

5. **Estimate Issues:**
Once you've selected the issues for the sprint, you can estimate the amount of work required for each issue using story points or time estimates. Click on an issue to open it, then click on the "Edit" button to enter the estimate in the appropriate field.

6. **Prioritize the Sprint Backlog:**
Arrange the issues in the sprint backlog in priority order. You can drag and drop issues to reorder them based on their importance or dependency.

7. **Review Capacity:**
Review the team's capacity for the sprint in terms of available hours or story points. Make sure that the total estimated effort for the sprint does not exceed the team's capacity.

8. **Adjust as Necessary:**
As you plan the sprint, you may need to make adjustments based on feedback from the team or changes in priorities. Be prepared to add, remove, or re-prioritize issues as needed to ensure that the sprint is achievable and aligned with the project goals.

9. **Finalize the Sprint:**
Once you're satisfied with the sprint plan, click the "Start sprint" button to finalize the sprint. This will move the selected issues from the backlog into the active sprint, and your team can begin working on them.

10. **Monitor Progress:**
Throughout the sprint, monitor the progress of the team and the sprint backlog in Jira. You can use the "Active sprints" view to track the status of individual issues, update progress, and make adjustments as necessary.

That's it! By following these steps, you can effectively plan and manage sprints in Jira to ensure that your team stays on track and delivers value to your stakeholders.
