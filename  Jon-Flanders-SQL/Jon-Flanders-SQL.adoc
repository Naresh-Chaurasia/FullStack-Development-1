== SQL Queries

=== CREATE TABLE

----
CREATE TABLE students (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT,
    grade VARCHAR(10)
);

----

=== INSERT SAMPLE RECORDS INTO THE STUDENTS TABLE

----
INSERT INTO students (first_name, last_name, age, grade) VALUES
('John', 'Doe', 18, 'Senior'),
('Jane', 'Smith', 17, 'Junior'),
('Michael', 'Johnson', 16, 'Sophomore'),
('Emily', 'Williams', 15, 'Freshman');
----

=== UPDATE COLUMN IN STUDENT TABLE

----
UPDATE students
SET grade = 'Senior (Honor)'
WHERE first_name = 'John';
----

=== DELETE A RECORD FROM STUDENT TABLE

----
DELETE FROM students
WHERE age < 16;
----

=== ALTER COLUMN NAME FROM STUDENT TABLE

----
ALTER TABLE students
RENAME COLUMN grade TO class;
----

=== ORDER BY

----
SELECT first_name, last_name, age
FROM students
ORDER BY age DESC;
----

=== GROUP BY

----
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_id INT,
    quantity INT
);


INSERT INTO orders (product_id, quantity) VALUES
(1, 10),
(1, 15),
(2, 20),
(2, 25),
(3, 30),
(3, 35);

SELECT product_id, SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM orders
GROUP BY product_id;
----

=== GROUP BY AND HAVING

----
SELECT product_id, SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM orders
GROUP BY product_id
HAVING SUM(quantity) > 30;
----

=== UNIQUE KEY

----

CREATE TABLE inventory (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(100),
    sku VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
    quantity INT,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

CREATE TABLE inventory (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(100),
    sku VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
    quantity INT,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2)
);
----

*COMPOSITE KEY*

----

CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT,
    department_id INT,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    PRIMARY KEY (employee_id, department_id)
);


INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, department_id, first_name, last_name)
VALUES
(1, 1, 'John', 'Doe'),
(2, 1, 'Jane', 'Smith'),
(3, 2, 'Michael', 'Johnson'),
(4, 2, 'Emily', 'Williams');

-- This record violates the composite key constraint
INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, department_id, first_name, last_name)
VALUES
(1, 1, 'John', 'Doe');
----

=== FOREIGN KEY CONSTRAINT

----
-- Create the departments table
CREATE TABLE departments (
    department_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    department_name VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Create the employees table with a foreign key constraint
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    department_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(department_id)
);


-- Insert data into the departments table
INSERT INTO departments (department_id, department_name) VALUES
(1, 'Sales'),
(2, 'Marketing'),
(3, 'Human Resources');

-- Insert data into the employees table
INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name, department_id) VALUES
(1, 'John', 'Doe', 1),  -- Employee John Doe belongs to Sales department
(2, 'Jane', 'Smith', 2), -- Employee Jane Smith belongs to Marketing department
(3, 'Michael', 'Johnson', 1), -- Employee Michael Johnson belongs to Sales department
(4, 'Emily', 'Williams', 3); -- Employee Emily Williams belongs to Human Resources department

----

* We first insert data into the departments table, specifying the department_id and department_name.
* Then, we insert data into the employees table, specifying the employee_id, first_name, last_name, and department_id. Note that the department_id values we insert must exist in the departments table due to the foreign key constraint.

---

=== DISTINCT

----
SELECT DISTINCT first_name, last_name, age, grade
FROM students;
----

=== LAST_INSERT_ID()

----
-- Create a table with an auto-increment primary key
CREATE TABLE example_table (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Insert a record into the table
INSERT INTO example_table (name) VALUES ('John');

-- Retrieve the last automatically generated ID
SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID();
----

Certainly! `LAST_INSERT_ID()` is a MySQL function that returns the last automatically generated value that was inserted into an AUTO_INCREMENT column. It's typically used after an INSERT statement to get the value of the last automatically generated ID.


In this example:

- We create a table named `example_table` with an `id` column that is an AUTO_INCREMENT primary key.
- We insert a record into the table with the name 'John'.
- We then use `LAST_INSERT_ID()` to retrieve the value of the last automatically generated ID, which is the `id` of the record we just inserted.

`LAST_INSERT_ID()` is often used in scenarios where you need to insert records into multiple tables with foreign key relationships, and you need to retrieve the generated IDs to maintain referential integrity between the tables.

---

=== SELF JOIN/LEFT JOIN

A self-join is a SQL join in which a table is joined with itself. It's often used when you need to compare rows within the same table.

----
-- Create the employees table
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_name VARCHAR(50),
    manager_id INT
);

-- Insert sample data into the employees table
INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, employee_name, manager_id) VALUES
(1, 'John', NULL),    -- John doesn't have a manager
(2, 'Jane', 1),       -- Jane's manager is John
(3, 'Michael', 1),    -- Michael's manager is John
(4, 'Emily', 2),      -- Emily's manager is Jane
(5, 'David', 2);      -- David's manager is Jane

SELECT e.employee_name AS employee, m.employee_name AS manager
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id;
----

=== INNER JOIN

An inner join is used to return rows from both tables that satisfy the join condition.

----
-- Create the employees table
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_name VARCHAR(50),
    department_id INT
);

-- Insert sample data into the employees table
INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, employee_name, department_id) VALUES
(1, 'John', 1),   -- John belongs to department 1
(2, 'Jane', 1),   -- Jane also belongs to department 1
(3, 'Michael', 2);  -- Michael belongs to department 2

-- Create the departments table
CREATE TABLE departments (
    department_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    department_name VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Insert sample data into the departments table
INSERT INTO departments (department_id, department_name) VALUES
(1, 'Sales'),
(2, 'Marketing');


SELECT e.employee_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;

----

=== RIGHT JOIN

A right join returns all rows from the right table (second table mentioned in the query) and the matched rows from the left table (first table mentioned in the query). If there are no matching rows in the left table, NULL values are returned for the left table columns.

----
-- Create the orders table
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    order_date DATE,
    total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

-- Insert sample data into the orders table
INSERT INTO orders (order_id, customer_id, order_date, total_amount) VALUES
(1, 101, '2023-01-15', 150.00),
(2, 102, '2023-02-20', 200.00),
(3, 103, '2023-03-25', 100.00),
(4, NULL, '2023-04-30', 250.00); -- This order has no associated customer

-- Create the customers table
CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Insert sample data into the customers table
INSERT INTO customers (customer_id, customer_name, email) VALUES
(101, 'John Doe', 'john@example.com'),
(102, 'Jane Smith', 'jane@example.com');

SELECT o.order_id, o.order_date, o.total_amount, c.customer_name, c.email
FROM orders o
RIGHT JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id;
----


=== FULL JOIN

A full join, also known as a full outer join, returns all rows from both tables, combining the results of both left and right joins. If a row in the left table does not have a corresponding match in the right table, NULL values are returned for the right table columns, and vice versa.

----

-- Create the orders table
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    order_date DATE,
    total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

-- Insert sample data into the orders table
INSERT INTO orders (order_id, customer_id, order_date, total_amount) VALUES
(1, 101, '2023-01-15', 150.00),
(2, 102, '2023-02-20', 200.00),
(3, 103, '2023-03-25', 100.00),
(4, NULL, '2023-04-30', 250.00); -- This order has no associated customer

-- Create the customers table
CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Insert sample data into the customers table
INSERT INTO customers (customer_id, customer_name, email) VALUES
(101, 'John Doe', 'john@example.com'),
(102, 'Jane Smith', 'jane@example.com');


SELECT o.order_id, o.order_date, o.total_amount, c.customer_name, c.email
FROM orders o
FULL JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id;
