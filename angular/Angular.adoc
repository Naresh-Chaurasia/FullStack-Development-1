=== How to Install Node on Mac

==== Using Homebrew:

1. **Install Homebrew**: If you haven't already installed Homebrew, open Terminal and run:
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2. **Install Node.js**: Once Homebrew is installed, installing Node.js is as simple as running:
```
brew install node
```

3. **Verify Installation**: After installation is complete, you can verify Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) by typing:
```
node -v
npm -v
```

==== Using Official Installer:

1. **Download Node.js**: Go to the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org/) and download the macOS installer.

2. **Install Node.js**: Double-click the downloaded .pkg file and follow the installation instructions.

3. **Verify Installation**: After installation, open Terminal and verify Node.js and npm by typing:
```
node -v
npm -v
```

==== Using NVM (Node Version Manager):

NVM allows you to manage multiple installations of Node.js. Here's how to install Node.js using NVM:

1. **Install NVM**: Open Terminal and run:
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
```

2. **Close and Reopen Terminal**: After installation, close and reopen Terminal, or run:
```
source ~/.bashrc
```

3. **Install Node.js**: Once NVM is installed, you can install Node.js by running:
```
nvm install node
```

4. **Verify Installation**: After installation, verify Node.js and npm versions:
```
node -v
npm -v
```

=== Common Commands

* NPM

----
npm install -g @angular/cli

npm start

npm install --save bootstrap@3

npm install
----

* NG

----
ng version

# create project with app.module.js
ng new angular3 --no-strict --standalone false --routing false

# create project
ng new my-first-project

# Start server on port 4200

=== What is Angular Framework

Angular is a popular open-source front-end web application framework maintained by Google. It is used for building dynamic single-page web applications (SPAs) and provides a comprehensive solution for structuring, building, and deploying web apps.

Here are some key features of Angular:

1. **Component-based architecture**: Angular applications are built using components, which are reusable and encapsulate both the UI and logic of a specific part of the application.

2. **Two-way data binding**: Angular facilitates automatic synchronization of data between the model (business logic) and the view (UI), allowing changes in one to be reflected in the other without the need for manual intervention.

3. **Directives**: Angular comes with a set of built-in directives like ngFor, ngIf, ngSwitch, etc., which extend HTML with additional functionality and allow developers to create dynamic views.

4. **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Angular has a powerful DI system that helps manage dependencies between different components, making the code more modular, reusable, and easier to test.

5. **Routing**: Angular's built-in router allows developers to build single-page applications with multiple views and navigate between them without a full page reload.

6. **HTTP Client**: Angular provides a built-in HTTP client module to make HTTP requests to a server, simplifying the process of fetching and sending data to backend services.

7. **Forms**: Angular offers both template-driven and reactive forms for handling user input and validation in web applications.

8. **Testing**: Angular applications can be easily tested using tools like Jasmine and Karma, which are supported out of the box.

Angular has undergone several major updates since its initial release, with AngularJS being the first version followed by Angular 2, Angular 4, and so forth. The latest version as of my last update is Angular 13, but there might be newer versions since then.

=== Angualar Framework Versions

Sure, here's a brief overview of the major releases of Angular:

1. **AngularJS (1.x)**:
- AngularJS, often referred to as Angular 1, was the first version of the Angular framework.
- It introduced concepts like two-way data binding and directives to build dynamic web applications.
- AngularJS was released in 2010 and gained significant popularity in the following years.

2. **Angular 2+**:
- Angular 2 was a complete rewrite of AngularJS and introduced many architectural changes.
- Released in September 2016, Angular 2 brought improved performance, modularity, and features like a component-based architecture.
- Subsequent versions, such as Angular 4, Angular 5, and so on, introduced incremental improvements and features while maintaining backward compatibility.
- Angular 4 was released shortly after Angular 2 and introduced improvements in size reduction and compilation.
- Angular 5 brought improvements in build optimization, HttpClient, and other features.
- Angular 6 introduced the Angular CLI, Angular Elements, and improved tooling.
- Angular 7 focused on performance improvements, CLI prompts, and Angular Material updates.
- Angular 8 introduced features like differential loading, lazy loading of routes, and the Ivy rendering engine (still in preview).
- Angular 9 saw improvements in performance and the introduction of Ivy as the default rendering engine.
- Angular 10 focused on improvements to the Angular CLI, Angular Material, and Ivy.
- Angular 11 introduced features like stricter types and improved component test harnesses.
- Angular 12 brought improvements to the Angular CLI, strict mode by default, and updated dependencies.
- Angular 13 continued the trend of improving developer experience, performance, and tooling.

Each release of Angular brought enhancements, bug fixes, and new features, empowering developers to build robust and scalable web applications. The Angular team has maintained a regular release cadence, providing updates and improvements to the framework.

=== Angular Metadata

In Angular, component metadata is data that defines how a component should be processed, instantiated, and used by the framework. This metadata is typically provided via the `@Component()` decorator, which is applied to a TypeScript class representing the component.

Here are some common properties included in component metadata:

1. **Selector**: Specifies the CSS selector that identifies this component in a template. When the Angular compiler encounters this selector in a template, it knows to render the associated component.

2. **Template/TemplateUrl**: Specifies the inline template or the URL to an external template file for the component. This defines the structure of the component's view.


=== What is Nodejs

In simple terms, Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server side. It's built on the Chrome V8 JavaScript engine, which is known for its speed and efficiency.

Node.js enables you to create web servers, build command-line tools, and perform various other server-side tasks using JavaScript. It's particularly popular for building web applications and APIs because it allows developers to use a single language (JavaScript) for both client-side and server-side development, which can simplify the development process and promote code reuse.

In essence, Node.js expands the capabilities of JavaScript beyond the web browser, making it possible to build full-stack applications entirely in JavaScript, from the front end to the back end.

=== What is Angular CLI

Angular CLI, short for Angular Command Line Interface, is a tool that helps you create, develop, and manage Angular applications more efficiently. It provides a set of commands that you can run in your terminal or command prompt to scaffold new Angular projects, generate components, services, modules, and more.

In simple terms, Angular CLI acts as a Swiss Army knife for Angular developers, automating repetitive tasks and providing a streamlined workflow for building Angular applications. With Angular CLI, you can quickly set up a new Angular project, generate code scaffolding, serve your application locally for development, and build optimized production-ready bundles for deployment.

It abstracts away much of the configuration and boilerplate code, allowing you to focus more on writing application logic and less on setting up build tools and project structure. Overall, Angular CLI is an essential tool for Angular developers to increase productivity and maintain consistency across projects.

=== What is bootstrapping

Angular bootstrapping is the process of initializing and starting an Angular application. It involves loading the root module of the application, compiling its components, and rendering the application's view.
