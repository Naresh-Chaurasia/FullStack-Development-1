=== How to Install Node on Mac

==== Using Homebrew:

1. **Install Homebrew**: If you haven't already installed Homebrew, open Terminal and run:
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2. **Install Node.js**: Once Homebrew is installed, installing Node.js is as simple as running:
```
brew install node
```

3. **Verify Installation**: After installation is complete, you can verify Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) by typing:
```
node -v
npm -v
```

==== Using Official Installer:

1. **Download Node.js**: Go to the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org/) and download the macOS installer.

2. **Install Node.js**: Double-click the downloaded .pkg file and follow the installation instructions.

3. **Verify Installation**: After installation, open Terminal and verify Node.js and npm by typing:
```
node -v
npm -v
```

==== Using NVM (Node Version Manager):

NVM allows you to manage multiple installations of Node.js. Here's how to install Node.js using NVM:

1. **Install NVM**: Open Terminal and run:
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
```

2. **Close and Reopen Terminal**: After installation, close and reopen Terminal, or run:
```
source ~/.bashrc
```

3. **Install Node.js**: Once NVM is installed, you can install Node.js by running:
```
nvm install node
```

4. **Verify Installation**: After installation, verify Node.js and npm versions:
```
node -v
npm -v
```

=== Common Commands

* NPM

----
npm install -g @angular/cli

npm start

npm install --save bootstrap@3

npm install
----

* NG

----
ng version

ng new my-first-project

ng serve

# This will also update app.module.ts
# Update app.component.ts `imports: [CommonModule, RouterOutlet, HomeComponent]`
# add tag to app.component.html
ng generate component home
----



== Angular Glossary

----
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: '<p>This is an example component with multiple inline styles.</p>',
  styles: ['p { color: blue; }', 'span { font-weight: bold; }']
})
export class ExampleComponent { }
----


=== Angular Metadata

In Angular, component metadata is data that defines how a component should be processed, instantiated, and used by the framework. This metadata is typically provided via the `@Component()` decorator, which is applied to a TypeScript class representing the component.

Here are some common properties included in component metadata:

1. **Selector**: Specifies the CSS selector that identifies this component in a template. When the Angular compiler encounters this selector in a template, it knows to render the associated component.

2. **Template/TemplateUrl**: Specifies the inline template or the URL to an external template file for the component. This defines the structure of the component's view.


=== What is Nodejs

In simple terms, Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server side. It's built on the Chrome V8 JavaScript engine, which is known for its speed and efficiency.

Node.js enables you to create web servers, build command-line tools, and perform various other server-side tasks using JavaScript. It's particularly popular for building web applications and APIs because it allows developers to use a single language (JavaScript) for both client-side and server-side development, which can simplify the development process and promote code reuse.

In essence, Node.js expands the capabilities of JavaScript beyond the web browser, making it possible to build full-stack applications entirely in JavaScript, from the front end to the back end.

=== What is Angular CLI

Angular CLI, short for Angular Command Line Interface, is a tool that helps you create, develop, and manage Angular applications more efficiently. It provides a set of commands that you can run in your terminal or command prompt to scaffold new Angular projects, generate components, services, modules, and more.

In simple terms, Angular CLI acts as a Swiss Army knife for Angular developers, automating repetitive tasks and providing a streamlined workflow for building Angular applications. With Angular CLI, you can quickly set up a new Angular project, generate code scaffolding, serve your application locally for development, and build optimized production-ready bundles for deployment.

It abstracts away much of the configuration and boilerplate code, allowing you to focus more on writing application logic and less on setting up build tools and project structure. Overall, Angular CLI is an essential tool for Angular developers to increase productivity and maintain consistency across projects.

=== What is bootstrapping

Angular bootstrapping is the process of initializing and starting an Angular application. It involves loading the root module of the application, compiling its components, and rendering the application's view.
