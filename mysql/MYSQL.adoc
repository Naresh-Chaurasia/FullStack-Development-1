== What is ACID

Sure! Let's use a simple example to explain ACID in the context of MySQL:

1. **Atomicity**: Imagine you're transferring money from one bank account to another using MySQL. Atomicity ensures that either the entire transaction of transferring money happens successfully or none of it happens at all. So, if you're transferring $100 from Account A to Account B, MySQL ensures that either $100 is deducted from Account A and added to Account B completely, or nothing happens if there's an error. It's like all or nothing, no in-between state.

2. **Consistency**: Now, let's say you have a rule that no account balance should go below $0. Consistency ensures that this rule is always maintained, even during a transaction. So, if you're transferring $100 from Account A to Account B, MySQL ensures that after the transfer, both accounts still follow this rule. None of the accounts will end up with a negative balance.

3. **Isolation**: Imagine you and your friend are both transferring money from different accounts at the same time. Isolation ensures that your transaction doesn't interfere with your friend's transaction, and vice versa. So, even if you both are transferring money simultaneously, MySQL ensures that each transaction is processed independently without affecting the other.

4. **Durability**: Lastly, durability ensures that once a transaction is completed and confirmed, it stays that way even if there's a system crash or power outage. So, if your money transfer transaction is successful, MySQL makes sure that the changes made (like the deduction from Account A and addition to Account B) are permanent and not lost due to any unforeseen circumstances.

In essence, ACID ensures that your transactions in MySQL are reliable, secure, and consistent, even in challenging situations.

== "HaaS," "PaaS," and "SaaS"

In the realm of cloud computing, "HaaS," "PaaS," and "SaaS" are three different models that represent various levels of service and responsibility for users. Let's break them down:

1. **HaaS (Hardware as a Service)**: In this model, the cloud provider offers physical hardware infrastructure, such as servers, storage, and networking equipment, to users on a subscription basis. Users typically rent these resources rather than owning them outright. HaaS allows businesses to avoid the upfront costs and maintenance associated with purchasing and managing physical hardware. Instead, they can scale resources up or down based on their needs, paying only for what they use. Examples of HaaS providers include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

2. **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: PaaS provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the underlying infrastructure. The cloud provider manages the infrastructure, including servers, storage, and networking, while users focus on developing and deploying their applications. PaaS offerings often include development tools, databases, middleware, and runtime environments. This model enables faster application development, scalability, and flexibility for developers. Examples of PaaS providers include Heroku, Microsoft Azure App Service, and Google App Engine.

3. **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: SaaS delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis, eliminating the need for users to install, maintain, and update the software locally on their devices. Users access the software through a web browser or an API, and the cloud provider hosts and manages everything, including infrastructure, software, and data. SaaS applications cover a wide range of functions, including email, customer relationship management (CRM), productivity tools, and enterprise resource planning (ERP). Examples of SaaS offerings include Google Workspace (formerly G Suite), Microsoft Office 365, Salesforce, and Dropbox.

These three models—HaaS, PaaS, and SaaS—offer varying levels of abstraction and management responsibilities, allowing organizations to choose the level of control and flexibility that best suits their needs and resources.

== What is Database

Certainly! In simple terms, a **database** is like a well-organized digital filing cabinet where we store and manage information. Here are the key points:

1. **What is Data?**
- **Data** refers to raw and unprocessed information. For example, names, class, marks, etc.
- In computer language, data is any piece of information that can be translated into a form for efficient movement and processing.

2. **What is a Database?**
- A **database** is a structured collection of data that can be accessed or stored in a computer system.
- It's like a digital warehouse where we keep related information organized.
- Databases are managed using a **Database Management System (DBMS)**, which is software designed to handle data efficiently.
- Think of it as a way to store a large amount of data in one place and easily retrieve specific pieces of information.

3. **How Does It Work?**
- In a database, data is organized into **tables** consisting of rows and columns.
- Each row represents a specific record (like a student's details or a product), and each column represents a specific attribute (like name, age, or price).
- Databases are indexed, allowing for easy updates, expansions, and deletions of data.

4. **Types of Databases:**
- **Relational Database**: Made up of tables with data fitting predefined categories.
- **Distributed Database**: Portions stored in multiple locations, with processing dispersed across a network.
- **Cloud Database**: Runs on cloud computing platforms, providing access to data transparently.

In summary, a database is where we keep our digital treasures organized, making it easier to manage information, analyze facts, and make informed decisions!

== Database V/s Spreadsheet

*How is database different compared to spreadsheet*

Certainly! Let's explore the key differences between a **database** and a **spreadsheet**:

1. **What is a Spreadsheet?**
- A spreadsheet is like an electronic ledger—a digital version of paper accounting worksheets.
- It was created to store accounting information in tabular form digitally.
- Spreadsheets allow you to create tables, perform calculations using formulas, and manage data about one subject area.
- Examples include Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets.

2. **What is a Database?**
- A database is significantly more complex than a spreadsheet.
- It's a collection of data organized and managed using **Structured Query Language (SQL)**.
- Databases are typically formatted in rows and columns, similar to spreadsheets, but their capabilities extend far beyond.
- Unlike spreadsheets, databases can vary greatly in size—from small files on your desktop to massive cloud clusters.

3. **Key Differences:**
- **Data Structure**:
- Spreadsheets store a single table of data, while databases break data into multiple tables linked using special keys.
- **Functionality**:
- Spreadsheets are great for basic calculations and simple data analysis.
- Databases offer more advanced features like querying, indexing, and handling large datasets.
- **Scalability**:
- Databases can handle vast amounts of data, whereas spreadsheets are limited by the number of cells they can hold.

4. **Pros and Cons:**
- **Spreadsheets**:
- **Advantages**: Simple to use, suitable for small datasets, and easy calculations.
- **Disadvantages**: Limited scalability, less robust for complex data.
- **Databases**:
- **Advantages**: Powerful, scalable, efficient for large datasets, and better for data integrity.
- **Disadvantages**: May require more technical expertise.

In summary, if you need to track numbers or occasionally share lists, a spreadsheet suffices. For more complex data management or multi-purpose use, a database is the better choice!

== ANSI

*ANSI SQL (Structured Query Language)*

ANSI SQL stands for American National Standards Institute Structured Query Language. It’s a standardized language used for managing data in Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS).

== Data Types

=== String

**Types**: MySQL offers several string data types:

- **CHAR**: Fixed-length string, up to 255 characters.
- **VARCHAR**: Variable-length string, up to 65,535 characters.
- **TEXT**: Variable-length string with a maximum length of 65,535 characters.
- **BLOB**: Binary large object for storing large binary data, such as images or documents.

*Fixed vs. Variable Length*:

*CHAR*: CHAR stores fixed-length strings. When you define a CHAR column, you specify the maximum length of the string it can hold. If the actual string is shorter than the specified length, it is padded with spaces to fill the fixed length.

*VARCHAR*: VARCHAR stores variable-length strings. It only uses the amount of storage required for the actual string plus one or two bytes to store the length of the string. It doesn't pad spaces, so it can be more space-efficient for shorter strings.

----
-- Create a table with CHAR and VARCHAR columns
CREATE TABLE char_vs_varchar_example (
id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
char_column CHAR(10),
varchar_column VARCHAR(10)
);

-- Insert data into the CHAR and VARCHAR columns
INSERT INTO char_vs_varchar_example (char_column, varchar_column) VALUES
('hello', 'hello'),   -- 'hello' will be padded with spaces to fit 10 characters in the CHAR column
('world', 'world');   -- 'world' will be stored as it is in the VARCHAR column
----

=== Numeric Data

----
-- Create a table with INT and FLOAT columns
CREATE TABLE int_float_example (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    int_column INT,
    float_column FLOAT
);

-- Insert data into the INT and FLOAT columns
INSERT INTO int_float_example (int_column, float_column) VALUES
    (10, 3.14),
    (20, 6.28),
    (30, 9.42);
----

---

----
-- Create a table with DATE and TIMESTAMP columns
CREATE TABLE date_timestamp_example (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    date_column DATE,
    timestamp_column TIMESTAMP
);

-- Insert data into the DATE and TIMESTAMP columns
INSERT INTO date_timestamp_example (date_column, timestamp_column) VALUES
    ('2024-04-12', '2024-04-12 12:00:00'),
    ('2024-04-13', '2024-04-13 13:30:00'),
    ('2024-04-14', '2024-04-14 15:45:00');
----

== Database and Table Privileges

Certainly! MySQL provides a range of privileges that can be assigned to users on a database or table level. Here are the specific privileges related to databases and tables:

### Database-Level Privileges:

* **CREATE DATABASE**: Allows the user to create new databases.
* **DROP DATABASE**: Allows the user to delete databases.
* **ALTER DATABASE**: Allows the user to modify the structure of existing databases.
* **SHOW DATABASES**: Allows the user to see a list of available databases.

### Table-Level Privileges:

* **SELECT**: Allows the user to retrieve data from tables.
* **INSERT**: Allows the user to add new rows to tables.
* **UPDATE**: Allows the user to modify existing rows in tables.
* **DELETE**: Allows the user to remove rows from tables.
* **CREATE**: Allows the user to create new tables.
* **DROP**: Allows the user to delete tables.
* **ALTER**: Allows the user to modify the structure of existing tables.

These privileges can be granted or revoked using SQL commands like GRANT and REVOKE, providing fine-grained control over who can perform specific actions on databases and tables within a MySQL server.

=== GROUP BY

----
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_id INT,
    quantity INT
);


INSERT INTO orders (product_id, quantity) VALUES
(1, 10),
(1, 15),
(2, 20),
(2, 25),
(3, 30),
(3, 35);

SELECT product_id, SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM orders
GROUP BY product_id;
----




=== GROUP BY AND HAVING

----
SELECT product_id, SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM orders
GROUP BY product_id
HAVING SUM(quantity) > 30;
----


Certainly! Let's provide some sample data for the `orders` table and then demonstrate the examples I provided earlier:

First, let's create the `orders` table and insert some sample data:

```sql
-- Create the orders table
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name VARCHAR(50),
    total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    order_status VARCHAR(20)
);

-- Insert sample data into the orders table
INSERT INTO orders (customer_name, total_amount, order_status) VALUES
    ('Alice', 100.00, 'complete'),
    ('Alice', 200.00, 'pending'),
    ('Bob', 300.00, 'complete'),
    ('Bob', 400.00, 'complete'),
    ('Bob', 500.00, 'pending'),
    ('Charlie', 600.00, 'complete'),
    ('Charlie', 700.00, 'complete'),
    ('Charlie', 800.00, 'complete'),
    ('David', 900.00, 'pending'),
    ('David', 1000.00, 'complete'),
    ('David', 1100.00, 'complete');
```

Now that we have inserted sample data into the `orders` table, let's run the queries from earlier to demonstrate the use of `HAVING` clause:

1. Example using aggregate function in HAVING:

```sql
SELECT
    customer_name,
    COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM
    orders
GROUP BY
    customer_name
HAVING
    COUNT(*) > 5;
```

This query will return customers who have placed more than 5 orders.

2. Example without using aggregate function in HAVING:

```sql
SELECT
    customer_name,
    order_status
FROM
    orders
GROUP BY
    customer_name
HAVING
    MAX(order_status) = 'complete';
```

This query will return customers whose maximum order status is 'complete'.

You can execute these queries against the sample `orders` table to see the results based on the provided sample data.

=== UNIQUE KEY

----

CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    department VARCHAR(100)
);

INSERT INTO employees (id, name, email, department) VALUES
(null,'John Doe', null, 'HR'),
(5,'John Doe', null, 'HR'),
(1,'John Doe', 'john@example.com', 'HR'),
(2,'Jane Smith', 'jane@example.com', 'IT'),
(3,'Michael Johnson', 'michael@example.com', 'Finance'),
(4,'Emily Brown', 'emily@example.com', 'Marketing');



----

*COMPOSITE KEY*

----

CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT,
    department_id INT,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    PRIMARY KEY (employee_id, department_id)
);


INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, department_id, first_name, last_name)
VALUES
(1, 1, 'John', 'Doe'),
(2, 1, 'Jane', 'Smith'),
(3, 2, 'Michael', 'Johnson'),
(4, 2, 'Emily', 'Williams');

-- This record violates the composite key constraint
INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, department_id, first_name, last_name)
VALUES
(1, 1, 'John', 'Doe');
----

=== FOREIGN KEY CONSTRAINT

----
-- Create the departments table
CREATE TABLE departments (
    department_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    department_name VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Create the employees table with a foreign key constraint
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    department_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(department_id)
);


-- Insert data into the departments table
INSERT INTO departments (department_id, department_name) VALUES
(1, 'Sales'),
(2, 'Marketing'),
(3, 'Human Resources');

-- Insert data into the employees table
INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, first_name, last_name, department_id) VALUES
(1, 'John', 'Doe', 1),  -- Employee John Doe belongs to Sales department
(2, 'Jane', 'Smith', 2), -- Employee Jane Smith belongs to Marketing department
(3, 'Michael', 'Johnson', 1), -- Employee Michael Johnson belongs to Sales department
(4, 'Emily', 'Williams', 3); -- Employee Emily Williams belongs to Human Resources department

----

* We first insert data into the departments table, specifying the department_id and department_name.
* Then, we insert data into the employees table, specifying the employee_id, first_name, last_name, and department_id. Note that the department_id values we insert must exist in the departments table due to the foreign key constraint.

---

=== DISTINCT

----

-- Create the employees table
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    department VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Insert sample data into the employees table
INSERT INTO employees (name, department) VALUES
    ('Alice', 'Sales'),
    ('Bob', 'Marketing'),
    ('Charlie', 'Sales'),
    ('David', 'HR'),
    ('Eve', 'Marketing'),
    ('Frank', 'HR');


----

=== LAST_INSERT_ID()

----
-- Create a table with an auto-increment primary key
CREATE TABLE example_table (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Insert a record into the table
INSERT INTO example_table (name) VALUES ('John');

-- Retrieve the last automatically generated ID
SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID();
----

Certainly! `LAST_INSERT_ID()` is a MySQL function that returns the last automatically generated value that was inserted into an AUTO_INCREMENT column. It's typically used after an INSERT statement to get the value of the last automatically generated ID.


In this example:

- We create a table named `example_table` with an `id` column that is an AUTO_INCREMENT primary key.
- We insert a record into the table with the name 'John'.
- We then use `LAST_INSERT_ID()` to retrieve the value of the last automatically generated ID, which is the `id` of the record we just inserted.

`LAST_INSERT_ID()` is often used in scenarios where you need to insert records into multiple tables with foreign key relationships, and you need to retrieve the generated IDs to maintain referential integrity between the tables.

---

=== SELF JOIN

Certainly! Let's provide some sample data for the `employees` table and then demonstrate the self join:

First, let's create the `employees` table and insert some sample data:

```sql
-- Create the employees table
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_name VARCHAR(50),
    job_title VARCHAR(50),
    manager_id INT
);

-- Insert sample data into the employees table
INSERT INTO employees (employee_name, job_title, manager_id) VALUES
    ('John Doe', 'Manager', NULL),  -- John Doe is the manager (manager_id is NULL)
    ('Jane Smith', 'Employee', 1),   -- Jane Smith reports to John Doe (manager_id is 1)
    ('Alice Johnson', 'Employee', 1),-- Alice Johnson also reports to John Doe
    ('Bob Brown', 'Employee', 2);    -- Bob Brown reports to Jane Smith (manager_id is 2)
```

Now that we have inserted sample data into the `employees` table, let's run the self join query:

```sql
SELECT e.employee_name, m.employee_name AS manager_name
FROM employees e
JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id;
```

This query will return a list of employees along with the names of their managers based on the matching `manager_id` and `employee_id`. Here's the expected result:

[cols="2", options="header"]
|===
| employee_name | manager_name

| John Doe
| NULL

| Jane Smith
| John Doe

| Alice Johnson
| John Doe

| Bob Brown
| Jane Smith
|===



You can see that each employee's `manager_name` corresponds to the `employee_name` of their manager, achieved through the self join.

=== INNER JOIN

An inner join is used to return rows from both tables that satisfy the join condition.

----
-- Create the employees table
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_name VARCHAR(50),
    department_id INT
);

-- Insert sample data into the employees table
INSERT INTO employees (employee_id, employee_name, department_id) VALUES
(1, 'John', 1),   -- John belongs to department 1
(2, 'Jane', 1),   -- Jane also belongs to department 1
(3, 'Michael', 2);  -- Michael belongs to department 2

-- Create the departments table
CREATE TABLE departments (
    department_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    department_name VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Insert sample data into the departments table
INSERT INTO departments (department_id, department_name) VALUES
(1, 'Sales'),
(2, 'Marketing');


SELECT e.employee_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;

----

=== LEFT JOIN

Sure! Let's create an example with sample data and demonstrate a LEFT JOIN query.

Suppose we have two tables: `employees` and `departments`. The `employees` table contains information about employees, including their names and the department they belong to. The `departments` table contains information about departments, including their names and IDs.

Here's how we can create the tables and insert some sample data:

```sql
-- Create the employees table
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_name VARCHAR(50),
    department_id INT
);

-- Insert sample data into the employees table
INSERT INTO employees (employee_name, department_id) VALUES
    ('John Doe', 1),    -- John Doe belongs to department 1
    ('Jane Smith', 2),  -- Jane Smith belongs to department 2
    ('Alice Johnson', 1),-- Alice Johnson also belongs to department 1
    ('Bob Brown', NULL);-- Bob Brown's department is unknown

-- Create the departments table
CREATE TABLE departments (
    department_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    department_name VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Insert sample data into the departments table
INSERT INTO departments (department_name) VALUES
    ('HR'),   -- Department ID 1 is HR
    ('IT');   -- Department ID 2 is IT
```

Now, let's say we want to retrieve a list of all employees along with their department names. We can use a LEFT JOIN to ensure that all employees are included in the result, even if their department is unknown.

Here's the LEFT JOIN query:

```sql
SELECT e.employee_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
```

This query will return a list of all employees along with their department names. If an employee's department is unknown (i.e., their `department_id` is NULL), the corresponding department name will also be NULL. Here's the expected result:

```
+---------------+----------------+
| employee_name | department_name|
+---------------+----------------+
| John Doe      | HR             |
| Jane Smith    | IT             |
| Alice Johnson | HR             |
| Bob Brown     | NULL           |
+---------------+----------------+
```

In this result:

- John Doe and Alice Johnson belong to the HR department.
- Jane Smith belongs to the IT department.
- Bob Brown's department is unknown, so the department name is NULL.

---

=== RIGHT JOIN

Of course! Let's continue with the same example of the `employees` and `departments` tables, but this time we'll demonstrate a RIGHT JOIN query.

Suppose we want to retrieve a list of all departments along with the names of employees who belong to each department. We want to ensure that all departments are included in the result, even if they have no employees.

Here's how we can achieve this using a RIGHT JOIN:

```sql
SELECT d.department_name, e.employee_name
FROM departments d
RIGHT JOIN employees e ON d.department_id = e.department_id;
```

This query will return a list of all departments along with the names of employees who belong to each department. If a department has no employees, the corresponding employee name will be NULL.

Here's the expected result based on the provided sample data:

```
+----------------+---------------+
| department_name| employee_name |
+----------------+---------------+
| HR             | John Doe      |
| HR             | Alice Johnson |
| IT             | Jane Smith    |
| NULL           | Bob Brown     |
+----------------+---------------+
```

In this result:

- The HR department has two employees: John Doe and Alice Johnson.
- The IT department has one employee: Jane Smith.
- There is a department with no employees, indicated by the NULL value in the `department_name` column, and Bob Brown is listed as having no department affiliation.


=== FULL JOIN

Sure! Let's continue with the same example of the `employees` and `departments` tables, but this time we'll demonstrate a FULL JOIN query.

Suppose we want to retrieve a list of all departments along with the names of employees who belong to each department. We want to ensure that all departments and all employees are included in the result, even if they don't have a corresponding match in the other table.

Here's how we can achieve this using a FULL JOIN:

```sql
SELECT d.department_name, e.employee_name
FROM departments d
FULL JOIN employees e ON d.department_id = e.department_id;
```

This query will return a list of all departments along with the names of employees who belong to each department. If a department has no employees or an employee doesn't belong to any department, the corresponding department name or employee name will be NULL.

Here's the expected result based on the provided sample data:

```
+----------------+---------------+
| department_name| employee_name |
+----------------+---------------+
| HR             | John Doe      |
| HR             | Alice Johnson |
| IT             | Jane Smith    |
| NULL           | Bob Brown     |
+----------------+---------------+
```

In this result:

- The HR department has two employees: John Doe and Alice Johnson.
- The IT department has one employee: Jane Smith.
- There is a department with no employees, indicated by the NULL value in the `department_name` column, and Bob Brown is listed as having no department affiliation.

=== ROLLBACK


INSERT INTO orders (customer_name, total_amount, order_status) VALUES  ('Alice1', 101.00, 'completed')

=== SAVEPOINT

----
CREATE TABLE customers (
id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(100),
email VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Start a transaction
START TRANSACTION;

-- Update the email of customer with id 1
UPDATE customers SET email = 'john.doe@example.com' WHERE id = 1;

-- Create a savepoint named 'update1'
SAVEPOINT update1;

-- Update the email of customer with id 2
UPDATE customers SET email = 'jane.smith@example.com' WHERE id = 2;

-- Oops! Something went wrong
-- We want to roll back to the 'update1' savepoint
ROLLBACK TO update1;

-- Commit the transaction
COMMIT;

----

=== BLOB

In MySQL, the `BLOB` (Binary Large OBject) data type is used to store large binary data, such as images, audio, video, or other files. The size of a `BLOB` column is determined by the maximum packet size (`max_allowed_packet`) parameter in the MySQL server configuration.

By default, the maximum packet size in MySQL is set to 4MB (megabytes). This means that you can store BLOBs up to 4MB in size in a single column if you haven't changed the default configuration.

However, you can increase the maximum packet size to allow for larger BLOBs to be stored. Keep in mind that increasing the maximum packet size can have implications for memory usage and network traffic, so it's important to consider the potential impact on your MySQL server.

As for the maximum size of a file you can store in a `BLOB` column, it depends on the maximum packet size and the specific configuration of your MySQL server. If you have increased the maximum packet size, you can store larger files accordingly. For example, if you increase the maximum packet size to 16MB, you can theoretically store BLOBs up to 16MB in size.

However, it's worth noting that storing very large files directly in a MySQL database can have performance and scalability implications. For storing very large files, it's often recommended to use a file system or a specialized file storage system instead of storing the files directly in the database.
