== What is Nodejs


Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server-side, outside of a web browser. It's built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it lightweight and efficient.

In full stack development, Node.js is commonly used on the server-side to handle tasks such as:

1. **Building APIs**: Node.js is used to create API endpoints that communicate between the client-side and server-side of web applications. These endpoints handle requests from the front end, process data, and send responses back.

2. **Server-side rendering**: Node.js can be used to render dynamic web pages on the server-side before sending them to the client's browser. This is particularly useful for improving performance and search engine optimization (SEO) of web applications.

3. **Database interactions**: Node.js can connect to databases like MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, allowing applications to store and retrieve data efficiently.

4. **Authentication and authorization**: Node.js can implement authentication mechanisms such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth to securely authenticate users and authorize access to protected resources.

5. **Middleware**: Node.js middleware functions can be used to intercept and modify incoming HTTP requests or outgoing responses, enabling tasks such as logging, error handling, or authentication checks.

In full stack development, Node.js often works alongside front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (typically with frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js) to create a seamless user experience. Together, these technologies allow developers to build both the client-side and server-side components of web applications, making Node.js a crucial tool in the full stack developer's toolkit.
